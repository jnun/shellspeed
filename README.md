# shellspeed
Shell scripts that can speed up local work, keeping you in flow

## rules
 - Scripts in root must work for bash, zsh, sh and be tested on Linux, Mac, and virtual machines to be functionally reliable
 - Scripts that work only in bash, Linux, or that have unique dependencies are in appropriately named folders
 - Scripts should include any dependencies in the comments
 - Scripts are not malicious
